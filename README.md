# Issue Tracker

I started this project because I was tired of watching tutorials and wanted to actually build something. I figured the best way to learn was to dive in headfirst. So, here we are â€“ my very own issue tracking app.

I needed a playground to make mistakes, break things, and figure out how all these fancy technologies actually work together. This project has been my late-night companion, weekend obsession, and the cause of both frustrating debug sessions and A-ha! moments.

Note: Much of the design and functionality is inspired by Linear, Github, and Jetbrains YouTrack. They've got some seriously cool ones, and I thought recreating aspects of them would be a great way to learn.

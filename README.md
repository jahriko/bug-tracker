# Issue Tracker

I started this project because I was tired of watching tutorials and wanted to actually build something. I figured the best way to learn was to dive in headfirst. So, here we are â€“ my very own issue tracking app.

I didn't need another bug tracker. I needed playground to make mistakes, break things, and figure out how all these fancy technologies actually work together. This project has been my late-night companion, weekend obsession, and the cause of both frustrating debug sessions and A-ha! moments.

It's not perfect, and definitely not meant to compete with existing trackers out there, but it's mine, and I've learned more about building this than I ever did from tutorials.

Feel free to poke around, maybe even learn something along with me.

I should mention that much of the design and functionality is inspired by Linear and Jetbrains YouTrack. They've got some seriously cool ones, and I thought recreating aspects of them would be a great way to learn.
